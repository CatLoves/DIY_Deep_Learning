DIY_Deep_Learning is a Python package that provides two high-level features

DIY(Do it youself) Deep Learning is a python package for our own deep learning framework using pure Numpy, with the following highlights:
- **Education centered**: main purpose of this package is obtaining deep understanding of modern deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch, we will implement most of deep learning functions on our own, like convolution, batch normalization, dropout, etc
- **High reliability**: all important functions come with a unit test, corner cases are considered to ensure high reliability
- **High availability**:out of box example code is provided for all important functions for easy usage
- **Complete documentation**: Doxygen is massively used to help users know how to use functions.
